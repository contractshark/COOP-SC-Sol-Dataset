# SC-Sol-Dataset
The defect data set of solidness smart contract include CKBD and SC-Sol.
---
# Dataset
## Metrics
* CKBD
* SC-Sol
## Labels
* the number of contract defects
* the number of each type of vulnerability corresponding to the contract
# Tools
## Solidity AST Tool
solidity-parser-antlr](https://github.com/federicobond/solidity-parser-antlr)

## Python3.8
## Java13

# Raw data
## Solidity Code
The Solidity code comes from [Xblock](http://xblock.pro/ethereum/), where the file name represents the smart contract address of Ethereum.
## Defect data, i.e. labels
The defect data comes from [Blockchain Smart Contract Security Checking System](http://www.sjtubsrc.net/index.html). By inputting the address of the smart contract, the feedback result of the platform is obtained, and the label is obtained after data processing.
